    "questions": {
      "howToConvert": {
        "question": "How do I convert MP3 to WAV?",
        "answer": "Simply upload your MP3 file by dragging and dropping it into the upload area or by clicking to browse your files. Then click the 'Convert to WAV' button. Once the conversion is complete, you can download your WAV file."
      },
      "storageTime": {
        "question": "How long are my files stored?",
        "answer": "Your original MP3 and converted WAV files are automatically deleted from our servers after 1 hour. We respect your privacy and do not keep your files longer than necessary for the conversion process."
      },
      "bestSoftware": {
        "question": "What is the best free software to convert MP3 to WAV?",
        "answer": "For online conversion, our free MP3 to WAV converter offers high-quality results without installation. For desktop use, free software like Audacity, VLC, and FFmpeg are excellent options with additional audio editing capabilities."
      },
      "improveQuality": {
        "question": "Does converting MP3 to WAV improve sound quality?",
        "answer": "Converting MP3 to WAV does not improve the original sound quality. WAV is an uncompressed format that preserves the quality as-is, but it cannot restore information lost during the initial MP3 compression. However, WAV is better for further editing and processing."
      },
      "fileSize": {
        "question": "Why does the WAV file become so much larger than the MP3?",
        "answer": "WAV files are significantly larger because they're uncompressed, storing complete audio data without loss. MP3 is a compressed format that reduces file size by removing certain audio data. A WAV file can be 10 times larger than its MP3 equivalent while preserving the full audio quality."
      },
      "losslessConversion": {
        "question": "How can I convert MP3 to WAV without losing quality?",
        "answer": "To convert without additional quality loss, use our converter with the highest sample rate and bit depth settings. Remember that the original MP3 quality is already compressed, and WAV conversion preserves that existing quality but cannot restore already-lost information."
      },
      "onlineVsOffline": {
        "question": "Is it better to convert MP3 to WAV online or using desktop software?",
        "answer": "Online converters like ours are ideal for quick, convenient conversions without installation. Desktop software may offer more advanced features and batch processing, but requires installation and setup. The quality of conversion is comparable if using reputable tools."
      },
      "windowsConversion": {
        "question": "How can I convert MP3 to WAV on Windows without additional software?",
        "answer": "Windows users can convert MP3 to WAV without installing additional software by using our online converter directly in any browser. If you prefer using built-in tools, Windows Media Player can also perform simple conversions from MP3 to WAV."
      },
      "bestSettings": {
        "question": "What are the best settings for MP3 to WAV conversion?",
        "answer": "For the highest quality, use 44.1kHz or 48kHz sample rate (matching the original MP3), 16-bit or 24-bit depth, and maintain the original channel configuration (stereo/mono). These settings ensure optimal audio quality for most purposes while keeping the files manageable."
      },
      "conversionTime": {
        "question": "How long does it take to convert an MP3 file to WAV?",
        "answer": "Conversion time depends on the file size and your internet connection. Most conversions take just seconds to complete. Larger files (approaching our 100MB limit) may take slightly longer, but typically less than a minute with a standard internet connection."
